# Overview

A PowerShell Module for script state management.

## Background

Like any scripting language, there is not much discipline around creating and using variable.  Variables are disposable objects requiring trivial effort.

The undisciplined, unstructured, easy come easy go design is great for task oriented scripts.

Proliferation of variables with different scope can however be a headache for  maintenance and troubleshooting of application-type scripts.  

## Objective

A simple way to manage variables as state objects.
